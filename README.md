# SAPOR  
**Self-Analyzing AI-Powered Orchestrator for Recipes**

SAPOR is an AI-powered food recommendation system that treats **recipes like code**.  
It analyzes recipes for unhealthy patterns, explains why they are risky, and suggests healthier alternatives—while also learning user preferences over time and even analyzing its **own system design**.

## What is SAPOR?

Traditional food apps only count calories or apply basic filters.  
SAPOR goes deeper.

- Recipes are treated as structured programs  
- Ingredients act like dependencies  
- Unhealthy patterns are detected as “recipe smells”  
- AI refactors recipes instead of rejecting them  
- The system learns continuously from user feedback  

SAPOR is designed to be **explainable, adaptive, and self-improving**.

## Key Features

- Recipe Health Analysis  
  Detects nutritional anti-patterns such as excess sodium, sugar, or unhealthy fats.

- Explainable AI  
  Every recommendation comes with a clear explanation of why it was made.

- Recipe Refactoring  
  Suggests healthier ingredient substitutions with minimal taste impact.

- Personalized Learning  
  Learns from user behavior, preferences, and feedback over time.

- Sustainability Awareness  
  Evaluates carbon footprint and environmental impact of meals.

- Self-Analysis (Meta Feature)  
  Analyzes its own codebase to detect technical debt and optimization opportunities.

## How It Works (High-Level)

1. User selects preferences or a recipe  
2. Recipe is analyzed by AI agents  
3. Nutritional “smells” are detected  
4. A health score is calculated  
5. Refactoring suggestions are generated  
6. Results are explained clearly to the user  
7. Feedback improves future recommendations
